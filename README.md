# plpbn-tools
A group of tools relating probabilistic logic programs and Bayesian networks for static analysis and causal reasoning. 

The PLP-BN tools are written in tabled Logtalk. In order to run them, you need a copy of [Logtalk](www.logtalk.org) and a backend Prolog compiler which supports tabling. They have been tested using Logtalk 3.91.0 and both [SWI-Prolog](swi-prolog.org) 9.0.4 and [XSB](xsb.sourceforge.net) 5.1.
